## 📘 About

This repository is a **personal learning journey** where I solved one JavaScript problem each day, mostly inspired by **LeetCode's JavaScript challenges**. The goal was to build a stronger grasp of JavaScript fundamentals, write clean and reusable code, and become more confident in solving real-world problems using the language.

## ✅ What I Learned

Throughout this challenge, I explored and strengthened the following concepts:

- 🔁 Closures & Scoping
- 🧠 Functional Programming Techniques
- 🧩 Array Manipulation (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, etc.)
- 🔗 Object and Array Transformations
- ⏱️ Debounce, Throttle, Timeout & Interval Cancellation
- 🧮 Memoization and Caching Strategies
- 🧵 Async/Await & Promise Control
- 🔄 Method Chaining and Fluent APIs
- 📦 Custom Event Emitters

## 🛠️ How to Use

Clone this repository and run individual files using Node.js:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokulraktate/30-Days-of-JavaScript.git
cd 30-Days-of-JavaScript
node 01_Hello_World.js
````

Each file is self-contained and demonstrates a specific concept. You can also copy and paste the code into your browser's developer console.
